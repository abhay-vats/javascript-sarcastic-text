# Sarcastic Text Generator

A small and fun text transformer. It transforms text input in one of `Sarcastic`, `Funny` or `Unable to Structure` syntax.

Things I learned while building this:

- Array.from() method,
- Array instance methods like map, forEach, etc,
- And, how to put everything together while having fun!
